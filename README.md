# Freedi - Open Source Deliberative Democracy Platform

**Freedi** is an open-source platform for scalable deliberative democracy. It implements a novel consensus-building framework that enables meaningful participation at scale through continuous preference expression, open proposal generation, and real-time consensus measurement.

## The Problem: Scale vs. Participation

As groups grow in size, the complexity of collective decision-making increases exponentially. This forces societies to concentrate authority in small hierarchical subgroups. While this enables coordination at scale, it systematically underrepresents the interests of broader populations and limits collective learning.

Traditional voting mechanisms exacerbate these problems:
- **Binary choices** reduce complex preferences to yes/no
- **Fixed option sets** prevent discovery of better solutions
- **Winner-take-all outcomes** incentivize polarization rather than consensus-seeking

Freedi offers an alternative approach grounded in deliberative democracy research.

## The Solution: A New Deliberative Framework

Freedi combines three core innovations:

### 1. Open and Continuous Proposal Generation
Participants are not limited to a predefined list of alternatives. Anyone may introduce new proposals at any point during the process. When existing options are inadequate, participants can articulate revised or entirely new alternatives, keeping the solution space open and responsive.

### 2. Continuous Expression of Preferences
Rather than binary choices, participants evaluate each proposal using a continuous scale from strong opposition (-1) to strong support (+1). This captures both direction and intensity of preference, distinguishing proposals with mild support and strong opposition from those with moderate but broadly distributed approval.

### 3. Real-Time Aggregation with the Consensus Algorithm
Each proposal receives an aggregate score derived from all evaluations, updated continuously and made visible to participants. This dynamic feedback loop transforms decision-making from a static event into an iterative, adaptive system.

## The Consensus Algorithm

At the core of Freedi lies the **Consensus Algorithm**—a scoring mechanism that provides a statistically principled estimate of collective agreement.

### The Formula

```
Consensus Score = Mean − SEM
```

Where:
- **Mean** = average of all evaluations (range: −1 to +1)
- **SEM** (Standard Error of the Mean) = σ / √n
- **σ** = sample standard deviation
- **n** = number of unique evaluators

### Why This Formula?

The algorithm resolves a fundamental tension in preference aggregation:

| Problem | Simple Mean | Sum/Count | **Mean − SEM** |
|---------|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| Small group with perfect agreement | Overvalued | Invisible | Appropriately uncertain |
| Large group with moderate agreement | Undervalued | Dominates | Fairly weighted |
| New proposals | Equal to established | Cannot compete | Can grow naturally |
| High variance (polarization) | Hidden | Hidden | Penalized appropriately |

**Key properties:**
- **Penalizes small samples**: With few evaluations, SEM is large, reducing the score
- **Rewards consistency**: High variance increases SEM, lowering scores even with high mean support
- **Allows new proposals to compete**: As evaluations accumulate, SEM decreases naturally
- **Clear statistical interpretation**: The score represents a conservative estimate of true population support

### The Uncertainty Floor

To prevent manipulation by small unanimous groups (the "Zero Variance Loophole"), an uncertainty floor is applied:

```
σ_adjusted = max(observed standard deviation, 0.5)
```

This ensures that small samples with zero variance are treated as having uncertain consensus, while large samples with genuine agreement naturally exceed the floor.

### One Evaluator, One Vote

Each participant may submit only one evaluation per proposal (though they may update it at any time). This prevents manipulation through repeated voting.

## Proof of Concept: Real-World Applications

### Case 1: Rapid Collective Decision (5 minutes)
- **Context**: Selecting a name for a political organization
- **Participants**: 53 active participants from ~70 attendees
- **Proposals**: 26 distinct name proposals generated by participants
- **Outcome**: Clear convergence on "Kol HaAm" ("Voice of the People") within approximately 5 minutes
- **Validation**: Result confirmed through secondary voting mechanism

### Case 2: Complex Normative Deliberation (5 hours)
- **Context**: Developing a social charter on religion-state relations
- **Participants**: 40 participants representing secular and religious perspectives
- **Process**: Two facilitated sessions (2.5 hours each) with structured deliberation phases
- **Method**: Breakout groups (5-6 people), equal speaking time, iterative proposal refinement
- **Outcome**: Proposals achieving >60% consensus threshold were synthesized into a draft charter using AI
- **Reception**: Positive feedback and requests for wider dissemination

These cases demonstrate the system's ability to support both rapid convergence on simple decisions and sustained deliberation on complex, value-laden issues among heterogeneous groups.

## Platform Features

### Unified Statement Model
Everything in Freedi is a "Statement" with semantic types:
- **Groups**: Top-level containers for organizing deliberations

This hierarchical model enables unlimited nesting depth with full ancestry tracking.

## Limitations and Future Work

We acknowledge several important limitations:

1. **Manipulation Resistance**: The system is not yet robust against coordinated voting, preference misrepresentation, or fake accounts. Current implementations assume good-faith participation.

2. **Scale Testing**: Empirical evidence is limited to 40-70 active participants. Whether the framework maintains its properties at mass scale remains an open question.

3. **Strategic Behavior**: Research is ongoing into adaptive weighting mechanisms to promote fairness over repeated decision cycles.

4. **Facilitation Dependency**: Current success cases relied on structured facilitation. The system cannot yet substitute for facilitation quality and institutional context.

These limitations position Freedi as a research direction rather than a replacement for existing democratic institutions. Considerable work remains before deployment in contexts with substantial social, political, or economic consequences.
