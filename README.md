# Freedi - Open Source Deliberative Democracy Platform

**Freedi** is an open-source platform exploring solutions to democratic participation at scale. As groups grow larger, coordination becomes exponentially more complex, traditionally forcing decision-making into the hands of small groups. Freedi experiments with consensus algorithms and structured deliberation methods to enable broader participation in group decision-making.

## üéØ Project Goals

Freedi aims to explore how individual freedom and collective cooperation can work together. Based on research into five foundational pillars‚ÄîFreedom, Partnerships, Navigation, Grace, and Justice‚Äîwe're building tools to:

- Support both **individual autonomy** and **collective decision-making**
- Give **every participant a voice** while preventing manipulation
- Enable **larger groups** to reach meaningful consensus (our tests with up to 300 participants show promising results)
- Help **diverse perspectives** find common ground through structured dialogue

## üî¨ Current Implementation

### The Consensus Algorithm
We've developed a consensus algorithm that attempts to balance proposal quality with broad participation:
```
Consensus Score = (Average Evaluation) √ó ‚àö(Number of Evaluators)
```
This formula is designed to encourage broad participation while maintaining quality. We're actively researching improvements and welcome feedback from the research community.

### Three-Phase Deliberation Process (Being Tested)
Our current methodology includes:
1. **Research & Analysis**: Small groups explore the problem space
2. **Proposal Generation**: Individuals develop solutions independently
3. **Collaborative Refinement**: Groups work together to improve proposals

## üåü What's Available Now

### **Core Platform Features**
- **Statement Management**: Create questions and propose options for group discussion
- **Real-time Voting**: Participants can evaluate proposals using our consensus algorithm
- **Basic Group Organization**: Create and manage deliberation groups
- **Multi-language Support**: Interface available in multiple languages

### **Deliberation Tools (Beta)**
- **Structured Discussion Formats**: Templates for organizing group conversations
- **Consensus Visualization**: See how group agreement evolves in real-time
- **Chat Integration**: Discuss proposals within the platform
- **Export Results**: Document group decisions and reasoning

## üöß Features in Development

### **Enhanced Deliberation**
- **Automated Facilitation**: AI-assisted moderation for larger groups
- **Advanced Analytics**: Deeper insights into group dynamics and decision patterns
- **Cross-group Synthesis**: Better tools for combining insights from multiple groups
- **Mobile Optimization**: Improved experience on phones and tablets

### **Research Tools**
- **A/B Testing Framework**: Compare different deliberation methods
- **Data Export APIs**: Enable academic research on deliberation patterns
- **Customizable Algorithms**: Allow researchers to test alternative consensus formulas
- **Integration Tools**: Connect with other deliberation and survey platforms

## üìä Early Results & Ongoing Research

In our initial tests with groups ranging from 35 to 300 participants, we've observed:
- Consensus scores reaching 165 points in 2.5-hour structured sessions
- Approximately 85% of participants reporting satisfaction with the process
- Higher consensus scores compared to digital-only platforms

**Note**: These are preliminary results from limited testing. We're actively seeking research partners to help validate and improve our methodologies.

## üöÄ Potential Applications

We believe Freedi could be useful for:

- **Community Decision-Making**: Helping neighborhoods and local organizations reach consensus
- **Organizational Planning**: Supporting teams in collaborative strategy development
- **Educational Settings**: Teaching deliberative skills while making group decisions
- **Policy Consultation**: Gathering meaningful public input on proposed policies
- **Conflict Resolution**: Facilitating dialogue between groups with different perspectives

We're eager to work with organizations and researchers to explore these and other applications.

## üèóÔ∏è Installation

### üöÄ Quick Setup (Recommended)

Use our automated setup script for the fastest onboarding:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/delib-org/Freedi-app.git
cd Freedi-app
npm run setup:all
```

This will guide you through creating your own Firebase project and configuring everything automatically.

## üéì Theoretical Foundation

Freedi draws inspiration from multiple fields:
- **Cognitive Science**: How individuals and groups make decisions
- **Deliberative Democracy Theory**: Principles of inclusive participation  
- **Complexity Science**: Understanding coordination challenges at scale
- **Philosophy**: Insights from thinkers like Kant and Popper on knowledge and cooperation

We're working to synthesize these perspectives into practical tools, though much work remains to be done.

## üîÆ Our Vision for the Future

We hope to contribute to a world where:
- More people can meaningfully participate in decisions that affect them
- Diverse perspectives lead to better solutions
- Technology supports rather than replaces human judgment
- Democratic participation becomes more accessible and effective

This is an ambitious goal, and we recognize we're just at the beginning of this journey.
