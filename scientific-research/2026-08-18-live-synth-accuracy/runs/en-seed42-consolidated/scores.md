# Accuracy score

```

=== Live-synth accuracy — live-synth-accuracy-en-seed42 (en) ===
statements: 100   ground truth: 50 synths in 10 topics

ACCURACY  0.910  (excellent)    = 0.6·F1_synth + 0.4·F1_topic

--- direct accuracy: how many did it actually get right? ---
  SYNTH   50/50 pairs joined = 1.000   (50/50 joined cleanly, i.e. the pair and nothing else = 1.000)
  CLUSTER 0.840   = share of each theme's statements sitting in a group that represents that theme, averaged over 10 themes
  COMBINED 0.936  = 0.6·synth(clean) + 0.4·cluster

  per theme:   gathered into groups that stand for the theme / its statements
    digital-services          8/10  in  7 representing group(s); biggest group touching it: 8/10  score 0.800
    health                   10/10  in  6 representing group(s); biggest group touching it: 10/10  score 1.000
    transport                10/10  in  6 representing group(s); biggest group touching it: 10/16  score 1.000
    culture                  10/10  in  6 representing group(s); biggest group touching it: 10/10  score 1.000
    public-safety             4/10  in  6 representing group(s); biggest group touching it: 6/16  score 0.400
    jobs-and-economy          6/10  in  6 representing group(s); biggest group touching it: 6/6  score 0.600
    housing                  10/10  in  6 representing group(s); biggest group touching it: 10/14  score 1.000
    environment-and-waste    10/10  in  6 representing group(s); biggest group touching it: 10/10  score 1.000
    education                 6/10  in  6 representing group(s); biggest group touching it: 6/6  score 0.600
    parks-and-green-space    10/10  in  6 representing group(s); biggest group touching it: 10/10  score 1.000

--- synth level (did each paraphrase pair merge?) ---
  pairwise      P=1.000  R=1.000  F1=1.000   ARI=1.000
  pair recovery 50/50 ground-truth pairs merged (100.0%)
  false merges  0 pair(s) wrongly merged, 0 of them within the same topic
  synths        50 produced vs 50 expected

--- topic level (did the 5 synths of a theme group together?) ---
  pairwise      P=0.755  R=0.796  F1=0.775   ARI=0.752
  topics        11 produced vs 10 expected

--- coverage ---
  100/100 statements (100.0%) ended up in some cluster; 0 left as singletons
