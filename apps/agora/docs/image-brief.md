# Agora — Image Brief (French Revolution journey)

Every image the game shows, the screen it belongs to, and a ready-to-paste
generation prompt. **All prompts share one style capsule** so the whole journey
reads as a single film. Paste a prompt as-is into your image model (Midjourney,
DALL·E, Ideogram, Firefly, etc.).

> Images are **data, not hardcoded** — each lives on a scene's `imageUrls`
> (or a character's `portraitUrl`) in the topic package, and teachers can
> replace any of them per screen in the Topic Editor. Filenames below are the
> bundled defaults in `apps/agora/public/scenes/`.

## 0 · Shared style capsule (the "same style" contract)

Copy this verbatim — it is already embedded at the top of every prompt below.
If you regenerate a single image, keep this block unchanged so it matches.

```
Cinematic, richly painterly digital illustration for a children's educational
time-travel game. Semi-realistic, hand-painted feel — like a high-end animated
feature concept painting, not a photograph and not cartoon-flat. Dramatic
volumetric lighting, soft depth of field, fine painterly brushwork. A recurring
warm gold "time-lantern" glow appears somewhere in every frame as the game's
signature accent. Cohesive color grade across the whole set: deep indigo
shadows, warm gold highlights, parchment-cream midtones. Wholesome, hopeful,
age 10–14 friendly — intense but never gory. No text, no words, no logos, no
watermarks, no UI, no modern objects in historical scenes. 16:9 landscape.
```

Two sub-moods live inside this one style (same finish, same grade, same gold accent):

- **Time-Lab mode** — the present / the machine. Luminous white-and-blue
  near-future lab, the "CHRONOS" portal, swirling light. Hopeful, clean.
- **Era mode** — Paris, 1789. Painterly historical realism, overcast dramatic
  sky, cobblestones, tricolor blue-white-red. Weighty, alive.

### Technical specs

| Use | Aspect | Suggested px | Format | Max size |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Scene images | 16:9 landscape | 1536 × 864 | WebP (or PNG) | ≤ 1 MB |
| Home hero | 16:9 landscape | 1600 × 900 | WebP (or PNG) | ≤ 1 MB |
| Character portraits | 1:1 square | 1024 × 1024 | WebP (or PNG) | ≤ 400 KB |

Portraits render as small **circular** avatars — keep the head-and-shoulders
centered with headroom so nothing important is lost to the crop.

## 1 · App screens

### 1.1 Home hero — student landing `/`
- **File:** `public/time-machine.png` — ✅ **done**
- **Where:** `Home.ts` `.home-hero__image`, top of the join screen.
- **Prompt:**
```
[STYLE CAPSULE] Time-Lab mode. Hero shot of a friendly near-future time machine:
a large circular portal ("CHRONOS Series X-1") with a glowing blue spiral vortex
inside, mounted in a bright domed laboratory of white and pale blue, holographic
control panels floating beside it. Empty, inviting, awe-struck — an invitation to
step through. Warm gold light spills from the portal rim. 16:9.
```

## 2 · Framing scenes — Act I "Through the Tunnel"

### 2.1 Mission brief — scene `scene-intro` ("המשימה")
- **File:** `public/scenes/time-machine-briefing.png` — ✅ **done**
- **Where:** first scene students see; the briefing.
- **Prompt:**
```
[STYLE CAPSULE] Time-Lab mode. A warm female scientist in a white lab coat
briefs a small group of curious teenage students (backpacks, mixed genders and
skin tones, seen from behind) in front of the glowing blue CHRONOS time portal
in a bright white-and-blue lab. She gestures toward the swirling vortex; the
kids look up in wonder. Hopeful, cinematic, gold rim-light from the portal. 16:9.
```

### 2.2 Time tunnel — scene `scene-tunnel` ("מנהרת הזמן")
- **File:** `public/scenes/time-tunnel.png` — ⬜ **needed** *(better as an ≤8s video — `videoUrl`)*
- **Where:** pure spectacle between briefing and arrival.
- **Still-image prompt:**
```
[STYLE CAPSULE] Time-Lab mode. First-person plunge THROUGH a time tunnel: a
swirling vortex of blue and gold light streaks rushing past, faint historical
imagery (clock faces, Roman numerals, Parisian rooftops) dissolving in the walls
of the tunnel, a bright warm-gold vanishing point ahead. Motion, speed, wonder.
No people. 16:9.
```

#### 🎬 Gemini / Veo video prompt (image-to-video, 8 seconds)

Start frame: `time-machine-briefing.png` (the students at the CHRONOS portal).
Upload that image, set 16:9, 8s, then paste:

```
Animate this image into an 8-second cinematic time-travel shot for a kids'
educational game. Keep the exact painterly style, characters and color grade of
the source image.

0–2s: The blue-and-gold CHRONOS portal spins up — the vortex swirls faster, gold
light pulses along its rim, the scientist raises her hand, the students step
forward toward it, hair and backpack straps lifting in the energy wind.
2–5s: Camera pushes through the portal WITH the students — a euphoric plunge down
a swirling tunnel of blue and gold light streaks, translucent history rushing past
in the tunnel walls (spinning clock faces, Roman numerals, dissolving Parisian
rooftops), sparks of gold trailing off the students' silhouettes.
5–8s: The tunnel's warm-gold vanishing point blooms into a bright flash, then
resolves into a cobblestone street of Paris 1789 at dawn — tricolor flags, stone
buildings — as the light settles. End on a held, awe-struck beat.

Camera: smooth continuous forward push-in / dolly, slight acceleration through the
tunnel, gentle settle at the end. No cuts — one flowing shot.
Mood: wonder, hope, adventure — fascinating, never scary, no gore.
Lighting: luminous blue core with warm gold rim-light throughout.
Audio: a rising resonant hum building to a soft whoosh at the portal, shimmering
chimes through the tunnel, easing into faint 18th-century street ambience (distant
bell, murmur) as Paris appears.
No text, no words, no logos, no watermarks, no modern objects.
```

> **Tip:** if Veo drifts from the look, add "match the source image exactly, same
> illustration style, do not photorealize." For a pure text-to-video version (no
> start frame), prepend the `[STYLE CAPSULE]` block and describe the students at
> the portal in the first line.

### 2.3 The world you must understand — scene `scene-period` ("פריז, 1789")
- **File:** `public/scenes/french-revolution-intro.png` — ✅ **done**
- **Where:** the period explainer; arrival in revolutionary Paris.
- **Prompt:**
```
[STYLE CAPSULE] Era mode. Paris, 1789: a crowd of ragged but determined
commoners surges through a cobbled street toward the stone towers of the
Bastille, tricolor blue-white-red flags raised high, drums, smoke and dramatic
overcast sky. Heroic and alive, not gory. A shaft of warm gold light breaks
through the clouds. 16:9.
```

- **Prompt:**
```
[STYLE CAPSULE] Era mode. A crowded, smoky 1789 Parisian café: a young idealistic

but sympathetic, a man speaking for the hungry. Warm gold lantern-glow. 16:9.
```

- **Prompt:**
```
[STYLE CAPSULE] Era mode, symbolic. The Count (silk and powdered wig) and Camille
(plain worn coat) face each other across a plain wooden table in a neutral stone
room, tension softening into curiosity as they truly look at one another for the

```

lantern light, shallow depth of field, warm gold key-light. 16:9.
```

## 5 · Ending scenes

```

### 5.2 Honest disagreement — scene `scene-honest-disagreement`

- **Where:** `honestDisagreementEnding`; a dignified ending, not a defeat.
- **Prompt:**
```
[STYLE CAPSULE] Era mode, dignified-quiet. The Count and Camille shake hands or
nod respectfully across the plain wooden table at dusk, still disagreeing but
clearly understanding one another, the time portal's soft gold glow open behind
them signaling "we can try again." Calm, respectful, bittersweet-hopeful. 16:9.
```

### 5.3 Failure (try again) — scene `scene-failure`
- **File:** `public/scenes/ending-failure.png` — ⬜ **needed**
- **Where:** `failureEnding`; the camps drifted apart — but time travel means retry.
- **Prompt:**
```
[STYLE CAPSULE] Era mode, somber-not-hopeless. A cold empty Paris square at grey
dusk, a dropped tricolor flag on wet cobblestones, distant smoke — but in the
foreground the warm gold time portal reopens, inviting another attempt. Melancholy
softened by a second chance. No violence on screen. 16:9.
```

## 7 · Optional — EraMap 2.5D world (only if you replace the SVG map)

The journey map (`EraMap`) is currently hand-built **SVG**, so these are optional.
If you ever swap it for painted artwork, these are the `artwork` slots
(`mapBackdropUrl`, `locationVignetteUrls`). Same style capsule, **Era mode at
night** (this is the one place the "Era of Lanterns" night palette leads).

| Slot | Key | Prompt subject |
|---|---|---|
| Map backdrop | `mapBackdropUrl` | Panoramic painted night map of 1789 Paris — river, rooftops, lantern-lit streets, deep indigo sky, gold lanterns; empty stage for markers. 16:9. |
| Portal vignette | `portal` | The glowing gold-blue time portal on the map's edge. |
| Palace vignette | `palace` | The royal palace (left camp), blue-lit, ordered, grand. |
| Assembly vignette | `assembly` | The revolutionary assembly hall (right camp), red-lit, crowded. |
| Square vignette | `square` | The central town square (the agora) where idea-lanterns gather. |
