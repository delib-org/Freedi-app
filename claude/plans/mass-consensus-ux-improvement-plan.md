# Mass Consensus UX Improvement Plan

**Date:** January 2025
**Based on:** Pilot Program Report (September 30, 2025)
**Objective:** Address critical UX issues to improve completion rate from 53% to 75%+

## Executive Summary

The Mass Consensus pilot demonstrated strong initial engagement (31% entry rate) but suffered from a 47% drop-off between entry and completion. This plan addresses the identified issues through five priority areas, with special focus on technical fixes, user journey optimization, and process transparency.

## Key Findings from Pilot

### Success Metrics
- **31%** entry rate (372 of 1,200 recipients)
- **53%** completion rate from entrants (198 of 372)
- **42** organic proposals submitted
- **48-hour** turnaround for meaningful results

### Critical Issues Identified
1. **Technical Barriers (47% drop-off)**
   - Android bugs preventing proposal submission
   - Vote registration failures
   - Slow loading performance

2. **Process Confusion**
   - Users don't understand why they see only 6 proposals
   - Uncertainty about proposal visibility
   - Confusion about randomization fairness

3. **Content Redundancy**
   - Multiple similar proposals requiring duplicate voting
   - No merging mechanism (users must choose between own or similar)
   - Fragmented voting data across similar proposals

## Implementation Plan

## 🔴 PRIORITY 1: Critical UX Issues (Weeks 1-2)
**Goal:** Eliminate the 47% completion gap

### 1.1 Technical Bug Fixes

#### Android-Specific Issues
**Files to modify:**
- `src/view/pages/massConsensus/massConsesusQuestion/MassConsesusQuestion.tsx`
- `src/view/pages/massConsensus/votingSuggestions/VotingSuggestions.tsx`

**Actions:**
- Fix text input issues on Android devices

**File to modify:**
- `src/view/pages/massConsensus/introduction/Introduction.tsx`

**New content structure:**
```markdown
## How This Works
1. 📝 You'll see 6 random proposals (ensures fairness)
2. ⭐ Rate each proposal (your ratings are saved automatically)
3. ➕ Add your own ideas (they'll be shown to others)
4. 🎯 See top-rated proposals
5. 🗳️ Cast your final vote

⏱️ Estimated time: 5-10 minutes
```

### 3.2 Inline Process Explanations

**New component:**
```typescript
// src/view/components/processExplanation/ProcessTooltips.tsx
```

**Tooltip content:**
- "Random selection ensures every proposal gets fair visibility"
- "Your proposal is now in the pool and will be shown to other participants"
- "Similar proposals are grouped to make voting easier"
- "You're seeing different proposals than others to ensure broad coverage"

### 3.3 Real-time Status Updates

**Files to modify:**
- `src/view/pages/massConsensus/headerMassConsensus/HeaderMassConsensus.tsx`

**Add status bar showing:**
- Current step (2 of 5)
- Proposals evaluated (4 of 6)
- Time remaining (optional)
- Number of participants active

### 3.4 Submission Confirmation

**Enhance existing auto-save with:**
- Toast notification: "✓ Your proposal has been added"
- Proposal ID for reference
- Link to "My Proposals" page
- Estimated number of views

## 🟢 PRIORITY 4: Expanded Evaluation Capacity (Week 5)
**Goal:** Allow deeper engagement per session

### 4.1 Progressive Disclosure

**Files to modify:**

// After evaluation, show "Continue Evaluating" button
// Load 3-6 more proposals
// Maximum 15-20 per session
```

### 4.2 Batch Evaluation Mode

**New feature in:**
- `src/view/pages/massConsensus/randomSuggestions/RandomSuggestionsVM.tsx`

**Options:**
- Quick mode: 6 proposals (default)
- Standard mode: 12 proposals
- Comprehensive mode: 20 proposals
- Continuous mode: Keep loading until user stops

### 4.3 Skip and Return

**Allow users to:**
- Skip difficult proposals
- Return to skipped items later
- Mark proposals for further consideration
- Save evaluation session for later completion

## 🟢 PRIORITY 5: Enhanced Content Management (Week 6)
**Goal:** Improve proposal quality and user control

### 5.1 Proposal Preview & Editing

**Current:** Auto-save implemented
**Enhancements needed:**

**Files to modify:**
- `src/view/pages/massConsensus/mySuggestions/MassConsensusMySuggestions.tsx`

**Features:**
- Preview before final submission
- Edit window (5 minutes after submission)
- Character count and quality hints
- Suggestion improvement tips

### 5.2 Proposal Templates

**New feature:**

// src/view/components/proposalTemplates/ProposalTemplates.tsx
```

**Templates for common proposal types:**
- Policy change
- New initiative
- Problem statement
- Solution proposal

### 5.3 Quality Indicators

**Add to proposals:**
- Completeness score
- Clarity rating
- Similar proposal count
- Engagement metrics

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Updates

No schema changes needed for Phase 1 (using existing `averageEvaluation` field).

For Phase 2, consider adding:
```typescript
interface ProposalMetadata {
  similarityGroup?: string;
  qualityScore?: number;
  viewCount?: number;
  editHistory?: EditRecord[];
}
```

### API Endpoints

Existing endpoints to optimize:
- `/getTopStatements` - Already uses `averageEvaluation`
- `/getRandomStatements` - Add caching layer
- `/submitProposal` - Add similarity check

New endpoints needed:
- `/getSimilarProposals`
- `/groupProposals`
- `/getProposalMetrics`

### Performance Targets

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Initial Load | >3s | <1.5s |
| Proposal Fetch | >2s | <500ms |
| Vote Registration | Variable | <200ms |
| Auto-save | Implemented | Visual confirmation |

### Mobile-Specific Optimizations

1. **Touch Targets:** Minimum 44x44px
2. **Font Sizes:** Minimum 16px to prevent zoom
3. **Viewport:** Proper meta tags for mobile
4. **Gestures:** Swipe navigation support
5. **Offline:** Service worker for resilience

## Conclusion

This plan addresses all critical issues identified in the pilot while maintaining the existing auto-save functionality and respecting the user choice between own and similar proposals. The phased approach ensures quick wins in weeks 1-2 while building toward comprehensive improvements.

The key insight from the pilot is that users approve of the concept but struggle with execution. By fixing technical issues, clarifying the process, and reducing friction, we can achieve the target 75%+ completion rate while maintaining the quality of democratic deliberation that makes Mass Consensus valuable.
