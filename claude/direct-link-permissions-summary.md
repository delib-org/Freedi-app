# Statement-Level Permissions Implementation Summary

## What We've Accomplished

### Phase 1: Core Implementation âœ…
1. **Temporal Name Generator** - Creates names like "Clear Thought 123" for anonymous users
2. **Public Authentication Handler** - Auto-authenticates users for public statements
3. **Updated Authorization Hook** - Simplified two-level access checking (current or top parent)
4. **Updated StatementMain Component** - Added auto-auth trigger for public statements

### Phase 2: UI Updates âœ…
1. **MembershipSettings Component** - Complete rewrite with inheritance support
2. **Inheritance Checkbox** - "Inherit from parent group" option for sub-statements
3. **Default Inheritance** - Sub-statements inherit by default (checkbox checked)
4. **Visual Feedback** - Shows inherited access level when checkbox is checked
5. **Fixed Issues**:
   - SCSS import error resolved
   - Default inheritance working correctly
   - Deprecated Access.open values handled
   - Infinite loop in useEffect fixed
   - Undefined access value errors resolved

## Remaining Issues

### Phase 3: Public Access Auto-Authentication ðŸš§
**Problem**: When a new user accesses a public statement via direct link, they see the login screen instead of being auto-authenticated.

**Expected Behavior**: 
- User should be automatically authenticated (anonymously if needed)
- User should go directly to the statement without seeing login
- Temporal name should be assigned (e.g., "Clear Thought 123")

**Likely Causes**:
1. The `handlePublicAutoAuth` function may not be called early enough
2. The authorization check might redirect to login before auto-auth completes
3. The route guard might not be checking for public access correctly

**Next Steps**:
1. Check when/where `handlePublicAutoAuth` is being called
2. Ensure it's called before any login redirect
3. Verify the authorization flow for public statements
4. Test with completely new users (incognito mode)

## Key Files Modified

1. `/src/view/pages/statement/components/settings/components/membershipSettings/MembershipSettings.tsx`
2. `/src/controllers/db/statements/setStatements.ts`
3. `/src/controllers/db/statements/setStatementMembership.ts`
4. `/src/view/pages/statement/components/settings/emptyStatementModel.ts`
5. `/src/utils/temporalNameGenerator.ts`
6. `/src/controllers/auth/publicAuthHandler.ts`
7. `/src/controllers/hooks/useAuthorization.ts`

## How Permissions Work Now

1. **Top-level statements** - Always have their own `membership.access` field
2. **Sub-statements** - By default inherit from `topParentId`, can override with own `membership.access`
3. **Access Levels**: public, openToAll, openForRegistered, moderated, secret
4. **Public Access** - Should allow viewing without login, with auto-authentication

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Create new sub-statement - should inherit by default
- [x] Toggle inheritance checkbox - should clear/set membership
- [x] Change access levels - should update correctly
- [x] Handle deprecated 'open' values
- [ ] Access public statement as new user - should not see login
- [ ] Verify temporal names are assigned
- [ ] Test all access levels with different user states
