# Error Handling & Monitoring Roadmap

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### High Priority - DONE
- [x] Set up Sentry integration for production error monitoring
- [x] Research Firebase Analytics custom event tracking for errors
- [x] Implement root error boundary with user-friendly fallback UI
- [x] Create structured logger service to replace console.log/error
- [x] Set up Firebase Analytics SDK and initialize
- [x] Create analytics service with event tracking helpers
- [x] Integrate analytics with logger service for automatic event tracking
- [x] Implement time tracking for statement views with Intersection Observer
- [x] Add analytics tracking to user lifecycle events (signup, login, logout)
- [x] Add analytics tracking to statement actions (create, view, vote, comment, share)
- [x] Track notification enablement and validation errors

## 📋 Remaining Tasks

### Medium Priority

#### 1. Create Statement Engagement Scoring System
- [ ] Design engagement score algorithm
- [ ] Track votes, comments, views, shares per statement
- [ ] Calculate engagement levels (high/medium/low)
- [ ] Create background job for periodic analysis
- [ ] Send engagement metrics to Firebase Analytics
- [ ] Identify trending statements and patterns

#### 2. Create Error Handler Utilities for Firebase and API Errors
- [ ] Create centralized error handling service
- [ ] Map Firebase error codes to user-friendly messages
- [ ] Handle network errors gracefully
- [ ] Create typed error classes for different error types
- [ ] Integrate with toast notifications
- [ ] Add retry logic for transient errors

#### 3. Implement AsyncBoundary Component for Feature-Specific Error Handling
- [ ] Create reusable AsyncBoundary component
- [ ] Support loading states
- [ ] Handle errors with fallback UI
- [ ] Add retry functionality
- [ ] Support custom error messages per feature
- [ ] Integrate with logger and Sentry

#### 4. Create useAsyncOperation Hook for Consistent Async Error Handling
- [ ] Build generic hook for async operations
- [ ] Track loading, error, and success states
- [ ] Automatic error logging
- [ ] Support for retry logic
- [ ] Integration with toast notifications
- [ ] TypeScript support for operation results

#### 5. Update Toast Service with Structured Error Logging
- [ ] Enhance toast service to use logger
- [ ] Track toast interactions (dismissed, clicked)
- [ ] Support different toast types (success, error, warning, info)
- [ ] Add persistent toasts for critical errors
- [ ] Integrate with analytics for error tracking
- [ ] Support action buttons in toasts

### Low Priority

#### 6. Add ESLint Rule to Prevent console.log Usage
- [ ] Configure ESLint to error on console.log
- [ ] Allow only console.error and console.info
- [ ] Add pre-commit hook to enforce
- [ ] Document the rule in contributing guidelines
- [ ] Add eslint-disable comments where needed

#### 7. Migrate Existing console.log/error to New Logger Service
- [ ] Search and replace all console.log instances
- [ ] Replace console.error with logger.error
- [ ] Add appropriate context to each log
- [ ] Group related logs together
- [ ] Remove debug logs from production code
- [ ] Update developer documentation

#### 8. Add Performance Metrics Tracking
- [ ] Track page load times
- [ ] Monitor API response times
- [ ] Track component render performance
- [ ] Set up performance budgets
- [ ] Create performance dashboard
- [ ] Alert on performance degradation

## 🎯 Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Error Handling Infrastructure (Weeks 1-2)
1. Create error handler utilities
2. Implement AsyncBoundary component
3. Create useAsyncOperation hook
4. Update toast service

### Phase 2: Code Quality (Week 3)
1. Add ESLint rules
2. Migrate console statements
3. Update contributing guidelines

### Phase 3: Advanced Monitoring (Week 4)
1. Implement engagement scoring
2. Add performance tracking
3. Create monitoring dashboards

## 📊 Success Metrics

- **Error Rate**: < 1% of sessions with errors
- **Error Resolution Time**: < 24 hours for critical errors
- **User Engagement**: Track improvement in engagement scores
- **Performance**: Page load < 3 seconds on 3G
- **Code Quality**: 0 console.log statements in production

## 🔧 Technical Considerations

### Error Handling
- All errors should be caught and logged
- User-friendly error messages in Hebrew/English
- Graceful degradation for non-critical features
- Automatic error recovery where possible

### Performance
- Lazy load analytics on user interaction
- Batch analytics events
- Use Web Workers for heavy computations
- Implement request caching

### Developer Experience
- Clear error messages in development
- Easy debugging with source maps
- Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
- Documentation for common error scenarios
